      "value": "<p><em>Biome: Forests, Plains</em></p><p>A sulfur-scented, dead-looking variety of pumpkin that can grow in any temperate region and is cultivated by goblins as food. It grows rapidly over large areas, rendering the soil poisonous to other plants. It can be made into Devil's Soap, which is a stinking black paste that grants resistance to fire damage for 1 hour. Can also be combined with @UUID[Compendium.brodericks-compendium.plants.JvQJmITdrwyLNo0f]{Lizuara} to create an ointment called Neverdeath that, when applied to the forehead of a recently dead creature, will bring the character back from the dead up to 7 days from its death. If the resurrection ritual is completed improperly, the character becomes an undead. After successful application of the ointment, the character being treated must make 3 death saving throws unbeknownst to the rest of the party:</p><ul><li><p>3 successes or 2 successes and 1 failure will return to character to full health, fully living.</p></li><li><p>2 failures and 1 success will return the character to conscious undeath, returning the player as a revenant.</p></li><li><p>3 failures will return the character as a full undead, with the helpful intervention of an evil deity of death, returning the character as a Death Knight with no control over their actions. The Death Knight will attempt to fight, but can also be turned back to the ally as a revenant state if the ointment is applied once more and the Death Knight fails a DC 16 Cons. Save.</p></li></ul>",
