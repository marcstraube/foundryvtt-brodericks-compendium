      "value": "<p><em>Biome: Arctic, Forests</em></p>\n<p>Known for the gleaming blue color of the leaves, the tree often grows in thick copses throughout the north. The thin trunks of the trees are remarkably durable, despite high winds and heavy snowfall, and one use of the tree is the wood, which is often used by the Volodni craftsmen to create weapons and armor. Magically treating the wood, which is called &ldquo;bluewood&rdquo;, causes it to become as hard as steel, although only weighing half as much (crafting with bluewood requires special training from a masterwork craftsperson). High priced entertainers often burn small pieces of the wood, which creates leaping blue flames. The leaves and sap are often ground in the creation of a vivid blue dye that is used to dye clothes in the North, and often in the creation of inks for tattoos. One pirate fleet that has plagued the Sword Coast in recent years is notorious for their crews bearing frightening looking blue tattoos covering their faces.</p>",
