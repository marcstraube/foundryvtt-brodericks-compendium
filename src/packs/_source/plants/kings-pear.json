      "value": "<p><em>Biome: Forests</em></p>\n<p>A somewhat common tree growing to typically around 20 feet tall, King&rsquo;s Pear is a light brown, smooth-barked fruit tree that produces first large white flowers in the early spring, followed by fist sized fruits resembling orange pears. The pears can be eaten normally and taste refreshingly of citrus mixed with apple. However, the seeds of the King&rsquo;s Pear can be crushed and distilled with alcohol to draw out the seed&rsquo;s poisonous compounds. The resulting solution is a milky white color and smells slightly of cooked meat. After ingestion, the recipient must make a DC 15 Cons. Save vs. poison. On a failed save, the target begins to experience headaches and visual/auditory hallucinations, and the target takes [[/roll 3d8]] psychic damage and loses one point from wisdom. On a successful save, the target takes only have the psychic damage and has no secondary effect. The resulting hallucinations often cause the recipient to see things twist and warp into the shapes of vile and hideous monsters, seeking to cause them harm. Those under the poison&rsquo;s effects often lash out at those around them. Few people survive the initial hallucinatory period due to the sheer horror of the experience, but those that do go on to retain the paranoia that those around them could also shift into hideous creatures once again.</p>",
