      "value": "<p><em>Biome: Forests</em></p>\n<p>A species of deciduous tree that closely resembles oak, the weeping trees are often left alone while other nearby trees are cut down to use as timber, as strong superstitions surround the tree. One tale speaks of a nature demigoddess long since forgotten being banished to inhabit the trees after losing a fierce battle for dominance of the nature domain with Kalancha. Another speaks of a powerful druid sacrificing herself to save the forest, and her ghost living on within the branches of the weeping trees. During autumn the trees begin losing their leaves and begin dropping their seeds, which is what creates the sound the trees are known for. Each seed has a small petal, which is shaped in such a way that when it falls it creates a sound similar to a person softly crying. As the trees often grow in clusters and they drop several thousand seeds each, over the course of a few weeks in autumn it sounds as if the trees are constantly weeping.</p>",
